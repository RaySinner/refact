# Refact Agent Engine

Binary: `refact-lsp` — AI coding agent, HTTP + LSP server. Rust 2021 edition, async/tokio.

## Stack

Axum (HTTP), tower-lsp (LSP), tree-sitter extraction, SQLite + FTS5 (CodeGraph), SQLite + vec0 (VecDB memory plane), refact-codegraph, refact-codegraph-parsers, refact-codehealth, refact-codewiki, refact-git-intel, git2, headless_chrome, rmcp (MCP).

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release                    # binary at target/release/refact-lsp
cargo test --lib && cargo test --doc
bash tools/compile_bench.sh               # compile-time before/after benchmark
```

Release profile: `opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`, `strip = true`. It does not configure `codegen-units`; the separate `ci-release` profile inherits release settings, then overrides `strip = false`, `lto = "thin"`, and `codegen-units = 16`.

Dev profile keeps workspace crates debuggable but optimizes CodeGraph's parser and SQLite dependencies with `[profile.dev.package.*] opt-level = 3`: tree-sitter core, every tree-sitter grammar crate, `tree-sitter-language`, `rusqlite`, `tokio-rusqlite`, `libsqlite3-sys`, and `sqlite-vec`. This makes `target/debug/refact-lsp` indexing close to release speed for parse-dominated cold indexes; the first dev build is slower because these dependencies compile optimized, and the shared sccache setup mitigates repeated work across worktrees.

`cargo build`, `cargo run`, and release builds normally rebuild and embed GUI assets. `REFACT_SKIP_GUI_BUILD=1` skips that refresh only for API-only developer builds.

### Worktree delivery

Run checks in the worktree before landing its changes. `merge_worktree` squash-merges a worktree into the local `main` branch; it does not publish anything. Push separately afterward with `git push origin main`.

## Architecture

`GlobalContext` (`Arc<ARwLock<GlobalContext>>`) is the central shared state. HTTP server (Axum) and LSP server (tower-lsp) both hold a reference. Background tasks (workspace file watcher, CodeGraph indexer, VecDB memory-plane vectorizer, git shadow cleanup, knowledge graph, trajectory memos, agent monitor, OAuth refresh) are spawned via `start_background_tasks()` (~18 tokio tasks). Workspace indexing is routed through `indexing_routing.rs`: memory-plane files go to VecDB, while source-code files go to CodeGraph.

### Daemon upgrade safety

Daemon clients automatically replace a running daemon when its version is older. An equal-version executable-SHA mismatch is replaced only by a release build and only when `REFACT_DAEMON_NO_UPGRADE` is unset or empty; set `REFACT_DAEMON_NO_UPGRADE=1` to keep that daemon. Debug builds always keep equal-version hash mismatches, preventing local binaries from replacing an active developer daemon. Every actual replacement writes a warning naming the running daemon PID and address before shutdown.

`daemon_needs_upgrade_same_version_different_hash_upgrades` was inverted for debug builds because independently compiled local binaries commonly share a package version while having different executable hashes. The test continues to protect release hash replacement, opt-out behavior, and genuine version upgrades.

## Chat System

### Session State Machine

`SessionState` enum: `Idle`, `Generating`, `ExecutingTools`, `Paused`, `WaitingIde`, `WaitingUserInput`, `Completed`, `Error`.

### Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `NO_TOOLS` | Plain chat |
| `EXPLORE` | Context gathering with quick tools |
| `AGENT` | Autonomous task execution, full toolset |
| `TASK_PLANNER` | Kanban board management |
| `TASK_AGENT` | Execute task cards |

### SSE Events

Subscribe: `GET /p/{project_id}/v1/chats/subscribe?chat_id={id}` (project-scoped proxy path used by daemon frontends via `daemon::chat_client::ProxyChatClient`; the worker itself serves `/v1/chats/subscribe`). Events have monotonic `seq: u64`.

Key types: `Snapshot`, `StreamStarted`, `StreamDelta`, `StreamFinished`, `MessageAdded`, `MessageUpdated`, `MessageRemoved`, `MessagesTruncated`, `ThreadUpdated`, `QueueUpdated`, `RuntimeUpdated`, `PauseRequired`.

Background process completion is represented by a hidden `event(process_completed)` message delivered through `MessageAdded`. If a future dedicated `ProcessCompleted` envelope is reintroduced, keep it additive to `MessageAdded` and document it in both engine and GUI AGENTS before clients depend on it.

### Commands

`POST /v1/chats/{chat_id}/commands` — queued processing.

Variants (Rust enum names; on the wire they are flattened JSON objects with `type` in snake_case): `UserMessage` (`user_message`; optional opaque `client_message_id` is bounded to 256 characters and echoed on the server message for optimistic-client reconciliation, while the server owns `message_id`), `SetParams` (`set_params`, payload under `patch`; `autonomous_no_confirm` bypasses confirmation gating and `auto_compact_enabled` controls automatic compaction), `SetGoal` (`set_goal`, `content` plus optional user-set `budget`; omitted/absent means unlimited), `SetGoalBudget` (`set_goal_budget`, `budget`, user command path only), `UpdateGoal` (`update_goal`, `note`), `GoalControl` (`goal_control`, `action: pause|resume|stop`), `UpdateMessage`, `RemoveMessage`, `TruncateMessages`, `RetryFromIndex`, `Abort` (`abort`), `ApproveTools` / `RejectTools` (combined as `tool_decisions` with `decisions: [{tool_call_id, accepted}]`), `RestoreMessages`, `BranchFromChat`, `RestoreFromTrajectory`, `ClearDraft`, `SetDraft`, `Regenerate`. All carry `client_request_id`; optional `priority` is accepted. Goal command types are shared in `refact-chat-api`; do not import similarly named Buddy conductor goal types.

### Delta Operations

`AppendContent`, `AppendReasoning`, `SetReasoning`, `SetToolCalls`, `SetThinkingBlocks`, `AddCitation`, `AddServerContentBlock`, `SetUsage`, `MergeExtra`.

### Message Flow

```
UserMessage → queue → prepare (system prompt, knowledge RAG, history limit) → linearize → LLM stream → StreamCollector → tool calls → loop
```

- **`linearize.rs`**: merges consecutive user messages, strips thinking blocks for LLM cache compatibility.
- **`stream_core.rs`**: `merge_thinking_blocks()` — deduplicates by (type,index) → (type,id) → (type,signature); signatures are opaque, latest-wins replacement.
- **`history_limit.rs`**: tool-call repair + history validation (`fix_and_limit_messages_history`) plus shared helpers: `compute_context_budget` (counts every message including plan roles, tool-call arguments, thinking blocks, ~1K tokens per image), `pressure_for_used_tokens` (70/85/95% → Low/Medium/High/Critical), `compress_duplicate_context_files` (keeps the `context_file` role on tool-answering messages so pairs stay valid). `CompressionStrength`: Absent/Low/Medium/High.

### Compression contract

Chat compression produces first-class chat messages and runtime status, not trailing instructions.

- `compression_report` is a visible message role for deterministic/reactive compression reports. It stores Markdown content plus `extra.compression_report = { kind: "chat_compression_report", context_files_removed, context_messages_dropped, tool_results_truncated, tokens_before, tokens_after, estimated_tokens_saved, reduction_percent }`, uses `summarization_tier: "tier2_reactive"`, and is preserved by model-switch/new-thread sanitization.
- Trajectory compression and manual `compress_chat_apply` must share `build_compression_report_message()` (or the fingerprinted variant) and `insert_compression_report_at_boundary()`. The helper inserts the report at the earliest affected boundary while staying after the entire leading control prefix (`system`/`event`/`goal`/`plan`) and after the first user when present, and never between an assistant's tool calls and their results. Report equivalence for idempotent removal is decided by the stable `op_fingerprint` when both reports carry one (deterministic compaction hashes changed message ids, `compress_chat_apply` hashes its op lists, `compress_in_place` hashes options + affected ids); fingerprint-less legacy pairs still compare by metrics, and mixed pairs are never equivalent.
- Runtime compression status is carried on both `ChatSession` and `RuntimeState` as `is_compressing`, `compression_phase`, and `compression_reason`, and is emitted through `RuntimeUpdated` and snapshots.
- Active compression phases are `checking` and `running`; terminal phases are `applied`, `skipped`, and `failed`. Active phases must set/keep `is_compressing` consistently, while terminal runtime transitions clear stale active phases and preserve already-terminal phase/reason metadata.
- Segment summarization writes compressed assistant messages with `extra.compression.kind === "llm_segment_summary"`; these summaries remain visible UI artifacts and are excluded from repeated summarization by source metadata.
- The proactive per-iteration gate (`proactive_gate_quiet`) is event-silent: routine skips below the effective `auto_compression_cap`, with no eligible segment, or while another attempt is active record `compression_phase`/`compression_reason` on the session without emitting `RuntimeUpdated`, so the GUI indicator does not blink every generation round. An absent cap uses the selected model's context window, clamped by `context_tokens_cap`; forced reactive compression keeps full Checking/Running/terminal event emission.
- The proactive gate measures the post-linearize provider-visible context. Fresh provider input usage anchors the request that produced the latest assistant message, while the selected provider/model tokenizer counts that assistant output and later user/tool growth; when usage or a loadable tokenizer is unavailable, the structural provider-visible estimate remains the conservative fallback. A fresh usage anchor replaces the local estimate for the anchored prefix (it is never `max`-ed against it), and the tokenizer-less fallback counts `count_text_tokens` (~chars/3) — never raw byte length — so a below-cap chat is never rebuilt because bytes were mistaken for tokens. `ChatSession.provider_usage_stale` is set by every compression apply path and `reset_compaction_runtime_state`, then cleared on the next successful generation.
- `rebuild_session` budgets the rebuilt context from a usable frozen request prefix (`budget_prefix_is_usable`: schema 1, non-empty system prompt, and `tools_canonical` that is a JSON array). An absent or unusable prefix (first use, legacy chats, repaired transition chats with `system_prompt: null`, non-array tools) gets a local-only replacement built from the reserved tool catalog and the mode system prompt; `payload_request_cap` rejects unusable prefixes as `incomplete frozen request prefix` instead of reporting a missing system prompt.
- Reconstruction reports carry `metrics` (`messages_before`, `messages_after`, `tokens_before`, `tokens_after`, `estimated_tokens_saved`, `reduction_percent`) computed by `validate_output`; the GUI renders them on the `Context rebuilt` report card while it is collapsed.
- Quiet compression status writes (`set_compression_status_quiet`) never mutate state while another reserved attempt is active. `compression_attempt_active` is the single gate consulted by `start_stream`, the command queue, the goal monitor, handoff, and the scratch/context routes, and it refuses generation in three independent ways: an explicit abort flag short-circuits first; an attempt whose `compression_attempt_started_at_ms` is older than `COMPRESSION_ATTEMPT_STALE_AFTER` (15 minutes) is treated as stale so a hung or aborted summarizer cannot wedge `is_compressing` forever; and an attempt with no timestamp at all fails closed and stays active. The reconstruction subchat is additionally awaited under `RECONSTRUCTION_TIMEOUT` (10 minutes) and a timeout writes the terminal `Failed` phase through the same path as a provider error, so every attempt reaches a terminal phase well before the staleness backstop is needed. `AttemptGuard::drop` publishes that terminal phase before raising the abort flag whenever the session lock is free, closing the window where the attempt reads as cancelled while `is_compressing` is still true.
- Source-preserving summary suppression is id-membership-based at linearize time: a summary's `summarized_source_message_ids` suppress exactly the present source messages with those ids, minus `preserved_source_message_ids`; `user`/`system`/`plan`/`goal` roles and `Never`-exempt messages never suppress, and exempt `event` roles (every subkind except DropOnAge ones like `mode_switch`/`tick`) always stay on the wire even when listed as summarized sources — segment collection also refuses to put them (or any message already covered by an active summary) inside a new segment. The stored `source_hash` is diagnostic metadata and never gates suppression: engine-side compaction legitimately mutates sources in place after summarization, and a hash gate would silently disable compression exactly when the context is under pressure. When sources are not fully present (handoff/branch flows carry summaries without their sources on purpose), the summary stays visible as carried context and absent ids simply suppress nothing. `remove_message`/`truncate_messages` invalidate referencing summaries like `update_message` does (in-thread orphans are removed at mutation time), ctx_apply/deterministic sweeps prune dropped message ids from summary id arrays in the modifiable prefix so metadata stays truthful, and new-thread/model-switch sanitization recomputes summary + report `source_hash` over the fully-present sanitized sources.
- Preserved tool/diff results expand to their whole call group at summary build and metadata refresh time (`expand_preserved_call_groups`): the calling assistant plus every sibling result answering its calls join `preserved_source_message_ids`, so wire suppression never orphans a preserved tool result (an orphaned result keeps a dangling `tool_call_id` and history repair silently drops it — observed as data loss in field trajectories). Preserved `context_file` results whose call is suppressed are instead detached (`tool_call_id` cleared) at linearize time.
- Candidates below `MIN_SOURCE_TOKENS_FOR_COMPRESSION` (2K), or larger than the summarizer's own input budget (`summarizer_input_budget_tokens`), are skipped. A summary must save at least 256 estimated tokens and 90% of its effective source. Insufficient spans are remembered per session, while every provider attempt records and durably saves both source-specific and episode-wide ten-minute cooldowns before dispatch; a failed save prevents the provider call, and successful application clears only the source hash. Explicit edit/remove/truncate/replace operations clear cooldowns because the source graph changed. Privacy provenance keeps every distinct file record, with stable HashSet-backed deduplication.
- Applied report + summary pairs are emitted immediately as `MessageAdded` events (plus the final snapshot), so reports stay visible even if a later pass aborts.
- One compression episode makes zero or one provider call against the largest budget-fitting eligible candidate and accepts it only when effective reduction is at least 90%. The compression-specific subchat disables context-limit, empty-choice, forced-final, and wrap-up retries, and the episode cooldown prevents immediate follow-up calls against another candidate. Candidates never include sources already covered by an active summary, spans must contain summarizable text, and post-await application revalidates every source ID/hash. The per-attempt abort token is propagated into the summarizer subchat; invalidating ownership cancels provider work. Context-limit recovery allows one LLM compression; if the retry still overflows, it may apply one deterministic full sweep before final failure.
- The deterministic fallback (`apply_deterministic_compaction_for_recovery` → `tools::tool_compress_chat::deterministic_full_sweep`) runs when the summarizer LLM is genuinely unavailable (`CompactionOutcome::LlmUnavailable` — no usable summary model resolves, or every summarizer call failed with a provider/network error) and also when a forced context-limit compaction has nothing summarizable (`CompactionOutcome::NothingToCompact` — e.g. a single span larger than the summarizer input budget, or image-only history). The sweep is a single maximal `ctx_apply` pass over the whole transcript — dedup + drop every context file + drop all memories + drop standalone project-info system messages + truncate every eligible tool result (redacting before truncating) + replace non-text multimodal elements with `[non-text content removed by compression]` placeholders — with no preserved-turn window: it is the last-resort recovery and may truncate the failing turn's own oversized outputs. It prunes dropped source ids from summary metadata, inserts a `compression_report` (equivalent-report deduplication is scoped to the modifiable prefix, so preserved/immutable tails stay byte-identical), resets `previous_response_id`, forces the cache guard, then generation retries. `drop_project_information` only affects standalone system messages; project info fused into the first system prompt is regenerated per request and governed by `include_project_info`.
- `compress_duplicate_context_files` treats a newer attachment of the same path with the same line range as superseding older copies (the file may have changed); across different ranges the largest copy still wins, with newer preferred on size ties. Wire preparation (`fix_and_limit_messages_history`) relocates stray tool results to sit contiguously after their assistant call, and history validation rejects results separated from their call by a `user`/`assistant`/`system` barrier.
- Forced context-limit compression that still cannot apply appends a visible `event(system_notice, "chat.summarizer")` whose content starts with `Context compression failed:`; context-overflow threads must never fail without a visible explanation. Every owned forced-skip path appends the notice (auto-compact disabled, busy session/draft pending, pending tool calls, no eligible segment, insufficient savings); only the attempt-already-active path stays silent because the owning attempt reports its own outcome. The notice may precede a successful deterministic-sweep recovery, in which case generation retries after the sweep's `compression_report`. The final hard error message points at `ctx_probe()`/`ctx_apply()`.
- Provider length stops (`finish_reason: length`-class) are auto-recovered in `maybe_recover_after_length_stop`: empty/near-empty outputs (e.g. reasoning ate the budget) drop the dead-end assistant message, boost `max_new_tokens` once via `pending_max_new_tokens_boost` (16K, only when the user has not set `thread.max_tokens`), append a `cd_instruction` marker (`length_stop_continue`), and retry; partial cuts append a continue instruction and retry. The marker bound is checked **before** any compaction and is authoritative: recovery is bounded by marker count per user turn (max 2), every retry — including compaction-driven retries on the user-`max_tokens` partial path — appends a marker, and exhaustion appends a visible ui-only error without running compaction. High-pressure empty stops still trigger forced compaction first when the budget allows.
- Editing a message via `update_message` removes any segment summaries (and their reports, matched by `source_hash`) whose `summarized_source_message_ids` reference the edited message, so stale summaries never keep suppressing changed sources.
- `compression_report` never reaches the provider wire: prepare filters it, linearize drops it, and `render_extra::is_context_role` excludes it; the role is GUI-only.
- Compressed/truncated tool previews and public summarization failure text must redact sensitive values before truncating or persisting preview text, so split secrets cannot leak through length caps.
- Manual `compress_chat_apply` must follow trajectory compression placement, report-deduplication, memory-path detection, redaction, path-preservation, and provider-order tool-call cleanup rules. It only mutates the selected modifiable prefix; preserved and active tails remain byte-identical except for insertion of the current compression report at the boundary.

### Hidden message roles

The chat thread can contain hidden internal roles that are stored in trajectories and SSE snapshots but are not rendered as normal chat turns:

| Role | Stored shape | Purpose | GUI default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event` | `extra.event = { subkind, source, payload }` plus human-readable `content` | Internal facts such as mode switches, tool decisions, plan deltas, goal deltas, goal pursuit, cron fires, process exits, ticks, verifier reports, and notices | Hidden from normal transcript; shown in EventLog except `plan_delta`, `goal_delta`, and `goal_pursuit` |
| `goal` | `extra.goal = { mode, version, created_at_ms, supersedes, active, status?, budget, progress?, attempts?, events?, transferred_from?, transferred_to?, truncated?, original_chars? }` plus Markdown `content` | Single install-once base goal; body is capped at 96KB (`MAX_GOAL_BODY_CHARS`) and owns the active goal projection | Hidden from normal transcript; projected into `Snapshot.goal`, runtime goal fields, TUI `/goal`, and GUI TaskProgressWidget |
| `event(goal_delta)` | `extra.event = { subkind: "goal_delta", source, payload: { seq, truncated?, original_chars?, kept_chars?, at_ms? } }` plus Markdown `content` | Append-only goal updates; note content is capped at 16KB (`MAX_GOAL_DELTA_CHARS`) | Hidden from normal transcript and EventLog; merged into the synthesized goal/get_goal |
| `event(goal_pursuit)` | `extra.event = { subkind: "goal_pursuit", source, payload: { kind, at_ms?, gaps?, account_progress? } }` plus human-readable `content` | Internal pursuit facts such as verifier verdicts, re-arm gaps, monitor nudges, quiescence pauses, budget stops, and transfer notices | Hidden from normal transcript and EventLog; contributes to `GoalSnapshot.events` and TaskProgressWidget history |
| `event(mode_switch)` | `extra.event = { subkind: "mode_switch", source, payload: { from, to, reason, diff } }` plus human-readable `content`; `diff` carries resolved tool additions/removals (full counts and at most 20 names each), system-prompt and tool-confirm changes, integration/MCP/subagent permission deltas, and editing/dangerous-command auto-approval deltas | Explains the effective policy transition without changing the legacy `{ from, to, reason }` fields; `diff.resolved` is false only when either mode cannot be resolved | DropOnAge; hidden from normal transcript and EventLog |
| `plan` | `extra.plan = { mode, version, created_at_ms, supersedes, truncated?, original_chars? }` plus Markdown `content` | Single install-once base plan; body is capped at 96KB (`MAX_PLAN_BODY_CHARS`) | Hidden from normal transcript; latest shown in PlanBanner |
| `event(plan_delta)` | `extra.event = { subkind: "plan_delta", source, payload: { seq, summary?, truncated?, original_chars?, kept_chars? } }` plus Markdown `content` | Append-only plan updates; note content is capped at 16KB (`MAX_PLAN_DELTA_CHARS`) | Hidden from normal transcript and general EventLog; merged into PlanBanner/get_plan |

`EventSubkind` serializes in snake_case. Current subkinds:

| Subkind | Typical source | Compression rule |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_switch` | `chat.session` | DropOnAge |
| `tool_decision` | `chat.session` | PreserveWindow |
| `ide_callback` | `ide.bridge` | PreserveWindow |
| `process_completed` | `exec.registry` | KeepRecentN |
| `cron_fire` | `scheduler.cron` | KeepRecentN |
| `tick` | `tool.sleep` | DropOnAge |
| `summarization_marker` | `chat.summarizer` | PreserveAnchor |
| `verifier_report` | `chat.verifier` | PreserveWindow |
| `cancellation_note` | cancellation paths | PreserveAnchor |
| `system_notice` | assorted internal emitters | PreserveAnchor |
| `plan_delta` | `tool.update_plan` | Never |
| `goal_delta` | `tool.update_goal` / `chat.command.update_goal` | Never |
| `goal_pursuit` | `chat.goal_verifier` / `chat.goal_monitor` / transition helpers | PreserveAnchor |

Compression rules live in `crates/refact-chat-history/src/compression_exemption.rs`: `plan`, `goal`, `event(plan_delta)`, and `event(goal_delta)` are `Never` and must never be compressed, truncated by compression, or dropped; `event(goal_pursuit)` is `PreserveAnchor`; non-event/non-plan/non-goal roles are `PreserveAnchor`; unknown event subkinds default to `PreserveAnchor`. Keep the table above in sync when adding a subkind.

Wire mapping rules: provider adapters must never send literal `event`, `goal`, or `plan` roles. Normal `event` lowers to provider-visible user context with structured `<event subkind="..." source="...">` framing. Base `goal` lowers as `<goal mode="..." version="...">...` and must appear before `<plan>` whenever both are present; `event(goal_delta)` lowers as append-only `<goal-update seq="...">...` blocks. Base `plan` lowers as `<plan mode="..." version="...">...`; `event(plan_delta)` lowers as append-only `<plan-update seq="...">...` blocks. This keeps cached base goal/plan bytes stable while still exposing synthesized current goal and plan text to the model. `event(goal_pursuit)` remains a generic event block. Preserve Anthropic thinking/signature block order across hidden-role lowering.

### Plan tools

#### `set_plan`

Model-facing prompt: "Install the chat's single detailed implementation plan (Markdown). Provide exactly one of `content` (full plan body) or `path` (absolute path to a `.md` report). Fails if a plan already exists — use `update_plan` to evolve it."

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "content": { "type": "string", "description": "Full Markdown plan body. Optional; provide exactly one of content or path." },
    "path": { "type": "string", "description": "Absolute path to a .md report to install as the plan" },
    "summary": { "type": "string", "description": "Short description of what changed, ≤120 chars. Optional." }
  },
  "required": []
}
```

Returns `{ "version": 1, "supersedes": null }`, queues one hidden `plan`, and appends `event(system_notice, "tool.set_plan", {version, summary}, "Plan updated to v1")`. It rejects missing/non-string arguments, rejects calls that provide both or neither of `content` and `path`, rejects empty content, rejects `summary` longer than 120 chars, and rejects any second install before queuing with `a plan already exists; use update_plan to change it`. The stored base plan is capped at 96KB chars and records truncation metadata when capped. Available by default in `agent`, `task_planner`, and `task_agent` modes.

Example:

```json
{"content":"## Plan\n- Inspect scheduler docs\n- Update runbooks","summary":"Document scheduler surface"}
```

#### `update_plan`

Model-facing prompt: "Append an incremental update to the current plan (cache-safe delta merged into the current plan). Use when the plan evolves; it does not rewrite the original plan."

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "note": { "type": "string", "description": "Plan update note. Required." },
    "summary": { "type": "string", "description": "Short description of what changed, ≤120 chars. Optional." }
  },
  "required": ["note"]
}
```

Returns `{ "seq": number, "truncated": false }` for normal notes. Notes are capped at 16KB chars (`MAX_PLAN_DELTA_CHARS`); when capped, the result is `{ "seq": number, "truncated": true, "original_chars": number, "kept_chars": number }`. It queues one hidden `event(plan_delta, "tool.update_plan", {seq, summary, truncated?, original_chars?, kept_chars?}, note)`, and appends `event(system_notice, "tool.update_plan", {seq, summary}, "Plan updated (delta N)")`. It requires an existing or queued base plan, rejects empty `note`, and rejects `summary` longer than 120 chars. `plan_delta` is append-only, snake_case on the wire, `Never` compressed, hidden from the normal transcript and general EventLog, and merged with the base plan for current-plan consumers.

#### `get_plan`

Model-facing prompt: "Read the current plan installed on this chat. Returns the merged current content, mode, base version, creation timestamp, and delta count."

Schema:

```json
{ "type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": [] }
```

Returns `{ "plan": null }` when no plan is installed or `{ "plan": { "content", "mode", "version", "created_at_ms", "delta_count" } }`. `content` is synthesized from the base `plan` plus append-only `plan_delta` notes; the base plan bytes are not rewritten.

### Goal tools

Goal state has two synchronized representations: hidden `goal` + `event(goal_delta|goal_pursuit)` messages in chat history, and the `GoalSnapshot` projection exposed on snapshots, runtime updates, trajectories, and GUI state. All shared goal API types live in `crates/refact-chat-api/src/lib.rs`.

#### `set_goal`

Model-facing prompt: "Install the chat's single active goal. Fails if a goal already exists — use `update_goal` to evolve it."

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "content": { "type": "string", "description": "Full goal body. Required." }
  },
  "required": ["content"]
}
```

Returns `{ "version": 1, "supersedes": null }`, queues one hidden `goal`, and appends `event(system_notice, "tool.set_goal", {version}, "Goal updated to v1")`. It rejects missing/non-string/empty `content` and rejects any second install with `goal already exists; use update_goal`. The stored base goal is capped at 96KB chars and records truncation metadata when capped. Available by default in `agent`, `task_planner`, and `task_agent` modes.

#### `update_goal`

Model-facing prompt: "Append an incremental update to the current goal. Use when the goal evolves; it does not rewrite the original goal."

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "note": { "type": "string", "description": "Goal update note. Required." }
  },
  "required": ["note"]
}
```

Returns `{ "seq": number, "truncated": false }` for normal notes. Notes are capped at 16KB chars (`MAX_GOAL_DELTA_CHARS`); when capped, the result is `{ "seq": number, "truncated": true, "original_chars": number, "kept_chars": number }`. It queues one hidden `event(goal_delta, "tool.update_goal", {seq, truncated?, original_chars?, kept_chars?}, note)`. It requires an existing or queued base goal and rejects empty `note`.

#### `get_goal`

Model-facing prompt: "Read the current goal installed on this chat. Returns merged goal content, status, version, delta count, budget counters, latest verifier verdict, and gaps."

Schema:

```json
{ "type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": [] }
```

Returns `{ "goal": null }` when no goal is installed or `{ "goal": { "content", "status", "version", "delta_count", "turns_used", "tokens_used", "latest_verdict", "gaps" } }`. `content` is synthesized from the base `goal` plus append-only `goal_delta` notes; the base goal bytes are not rewritten.

#### `validate_goal`

Agent-facing completion check: validates the active goal against its success criteria, marks it `completed` and disables pursuit when met, or re-arms the active goal with returned gaps when unmet.

### Goal pursuit contract

`GoalSnapshot` fields are `content`, `version`, `active`, `status`, `budget`, `progress`, `attempts`, `events`, `transferred_from`, and `transferred_to`. `active=true` means ownership, not current execution; pursuit is allowed only when `active && status == Active`. `GoalStatus` serializes as `active`, `verifying`, `paused`, `completed`, `stopped`, `budget_exhausted`, `no_progress`, or `transferred`.

`RuntimeState` and `RuntimeUpdated` mirror `goal_active`, `goal_status`, `goal_turns_used`, `goal_tokens_used`, and `goal_no_progress_turns`. `Snapshot` carries `goal: Option<GoalSnapshot>`. `ChatCommand::{SetGoal, SetGoalBudget, UpdateGoal, GoalControl}` mutates the hidden messages/projection through the queue and persists trajectories. GUI command dispatchers send `set_goal`, `set_goal_budget`, `update_goal`, and `goal_control`; budgets are user-set only, while the `set_goal` tool remains unlimited.

Verifier-on-done gates finish-like tools (`task_done`, `finish`, `agent_finish`) before the session reaches `Completed`. Active goals move to `verifying`; the verifier runs in a cache-reusing fork of the parent chat with one hidden verification prompt. `GOAL: MET` records an attempt, emits `event(goal_pursuit, kind=verified)`, marks the goal `completed`, and then completes the session. `GOAL: UNMET` or an inconclusive verifier records gaps, emits `event(goal_pursuit, kind=verification_gaps, account_progress=true)`, counts a no-progress turn, re-arms the goal as `active`, and enqueues priority `Regenerate` without emitting a completed runtime or Buddy event. Re-arm is capped: once `progress.no_progress_turns` reaches `QUIESCENCE_NUDGES` (3) the unmet verdict stalls instead (`GoalVerificationApplyOutcome::Stalled`), the session completes, and the goal stays `active` for later pursuit. Verifier infrastructure failures (model/auth/network, cache-guard pause) never fabricate an UNMET verdict: `handle_verifier_failure` restores `verifying → active`, emits `event(goal_pursuit, kind=verification_blocked)`, sets a 5-minute backoff (`goal_verification_blocked_until_ms`, persisted in `TrajectorySnapshot` and restored on load), and the gate returns `VerificationUnavailable` so the session completes without a Regenerate storm. The `validate_goal` tool shares the same failure handler, so manual validation failures also arm the backoff instead of allowing immediate retry hammering. A `goal_control stop`/`pause` issued during in-flight verification is preserved by the verdict application (held status) and never silently re-armed. Stale `verifying` snapshots heal to `active` (or `paused` when unowned) in the trajectory load clamp so a crash mid-verification cannot wedge the goal. Verdicts additionally apply only while the parent `trajectory_version` still matches the verification fork (`apply_goal_verdict_guarded`, shared by the completion gate and `validate_goal`); if history changed mid-verification (queue command, edit, or compaction) the verdict is discarded as `Superseded` and the goal re-arms from `verifying` to `active` for a fresh verification.

The goal monitor nudges stalled active goal owners with hidden `event(goal_pursuit, kind=nudge, account_progress=true)` events and priority regeneration. The default nudge cooldown is 30s (`default_goal_budget_cooldown_ms`); non-explicit persisted budgets with the legacy 1.5s cooldown and no hard limits migrate to the new default on load. Consecutive nudges with no intervening messages coalesce into the existing tail nudge event instead of appending a new one: the payload gains `count` and `last_at_ms` while `at_ms` keeps the first fire. Nudge cadence uses escalating backoff gated by `progress.no_progress_turns`: the effective cooldown is `cooldown_ms << min(no_progress_turns, 8)` capped at 5 minutes, so a healthy stall (`no_progress_turns == 0`) keeps the base cadence while an idle/blocked goal backs off. After `QUIESCENCE_NUDGES` (3) consecutive no-progress nudges an active goal whose no-progress budget is unlimited (`budget.no_progress_turns` is `None`/`0`) goes quiescent: the monitor stops nudging, keeps `status = Active` (never auto-terminal for unlimited budgets), and emits one idempotent `event(goal_pursuit, kind=pursuit_quiescent)` per quiescent episode. When a generation ends in a non-retryable `ContextTooLarge` that compaction could not clear, `goal_monitor::mark_goal_blocked_on_context_limit` forces this same stop immediately (unlimited budgets stay `Active` but quiescent; finite no-progress budgets become terminal `no_progress`), so the chat stops auto-regenerating into the same wall and resumes on the next user message; it raises the counter through `goal_note_no_progress_turn` (ledgered `no_progress_noted` ops) and, for finite budgets above the quiescence floor, appends an explicit `status_changed(no_progress, "context_limit")` so replay and the verification CAS guard both observe the block. Quiescence re-arms on real agent progress (`goal_record_progress`) or when a genuine `ChatCommand::UserMessage` resets `no_progress_turns` via `goal_reset_no_progress`. Explicit finite no-progress budgets still terminate through the existing budget-exhaustion path instead of going quiescent. Goal hard budgets are opt-in: `max_turns`, `max_minutes`, `max_tokens`, and `no_progress_turns` are `Option` fields where `None` and `Some(0)` are unlimited/disabled; cooldown and no-progress token thresholds remain concrete. Restore must not derive `progress.started_at_ms` from creation time, and old implicit defaults (`10` turns, `15` minutes, `200000` tokens, `2` no-progress turns) migrate to unlimited on load only when the budget lacks `explicit=true`; user-set budgets are stamped explicit by the command path and are never migrated. Turn-end accounting occurs after assistant output and can mark terminal `budget_exhausted` or `no_progress` status instead of completing.

Ownership transfer on `handoff_to_mode` and mode-transition routes carries the current goal into the target chat before any plan messages, preserves the source progress counters (backfilling `started_at_ms` only when it was 0), sets `transferred_from`, and marks the source `active=false, status=transferred, transferred_to=<target_chat_id>`. Only goals with `active && status == active` transfer; paused, stopped, completed, verifying, exhausted, and already-transferred goals stay with the source and are never re-armed by a handoff. Transfer appliers must set the source projection explicitly (`set_goal_projection`) after replacing messages because live projections win over pinned metadata on rebuild. Restart/reload rehydrates the same owner from `TrajectorySnapshot.goal` and hidden goal messages; it must not synthesize a transfer event.

Goal projection precedence: mutable pursuit state (`active`, `status`, `progress`, `attempts`, `events`, transfer markers) is owned by the live projection once one exists for the goal version; pinned goal-message metadata only seeds fresh projections (install, transfer-in, trajectory load without a persisted snapshot). `budget`, `content`, and `version` remain message-owned. `GoalSnapshot.events` is the union of message-derived pursuit/delta events and snapshot-only extras, deduplicated by `(kind, at_ms, text)` and capped at the most recent 100. The rebuild-time terminal-status heal applies only to freshly seeded projections; live stop/exhaustion decisions always stand. `goal_control resume` requires a paused or stopped goal; `goal_control stop`/`pause` purges queued goal-generated `Regenerate` commands (`goal-nudge-*`, `goal-verifier-regenerate-*`), and stop records `event(goal_pursuit, kind=stopped, trigger=goal_control)`. Branch flows that copy messages without transferring ownership (`BranchFromChat`, HTTP handoff-select) demote copied goal metadata via `demote_goal_ownership_for_branch` (`active=false`, `active`/`verifying` statuses become `paused`) so a branched chat never co-owns pursuit; ownership moves only through the transfer paths.

### Goal ledger

Every goal mutation is also recorded in an append-only ledger (`refact-chat-api::goal_ledger`): `GoalLedgerEntry { seq, at_ms, op }` with ops `installed`, `status_changed{from,to,reason}`, `progress_recorded{tokens,made_progress,cost_cents}`, `verifier_attempt_recorded`, `no_progress_noted`, `nudge_recorded`, `progress_reset`, `attempt_pushed`, `event_pushed`, `budget_set`, `criteria_set`, `snooze_set`, `transferred_out`, `transferred_in{progress}`. `ChatSession` goal helpers are the single funnel that appends ops; `rebuild_goal_projection_from_messages` auto-seeds a missing `installed` entry from the projection so legacy chats and side-effect-installed goals migrate lazily. Status flips triggered by budget changes (`handle_set_goal_budget_command`) and context-limit blocks go through `goal_set_status_reason`/`goal_note_no_progress_turn` so they are always ledgered and CAS-visible; do not mutate `goal.status`/`goal.progress` directly. Consecutive `nudge_recorded` ops coalesce into the existing tail entry (its `at_ms` advances) so nudge runs cannot grow the ledger unboundedly. The ledger persists in `TrajectorySnapshot.goal_ledger` (serde-default, additive; deserialization is per-entry tolerant — unknown future ops are skipped with a warning instead of emptying the ledger) and on load `reduce_goal_ledger` replays it into the prior passed to `goal_snapshot_from_messages` whenever the persisted snapshot is absent or unreadable; a present persisted snapshot stays authoritative. Transfers seed the target ledger with `seed_transferred_goal_ledger` (`installed` + `transferred_in` carrying the preserved progress) and append `transferred_out` on the source. Verification is epoch-guarded: the gate captures `goal_ledger_last_seq()` when `verifying` begins, and `apply_goal_verdict` discards the verdict (`Superseded`) if any `status_changed`/transfer op landed after that seq. `goal_budget_exhaustion_status` lives in refact-chat-api and is the single budget-transition function used by both the live helpers and the reducer.

### Evidence, cadence, and off-ramps

Turn accounting is evidence-based: a tool result added while a goal is installed sets `goal_turn_evidence` unless the tool failed (`tool_failed = true`) or resolves to an introspection/no-op tool (`sleep`, `get_goal`, `get_plan`, `pause_goal`, `snooze_goal`); `goal_record_progress_from_usage` counts the turn as progress when evidence exists or completion tokens meet `no_progress_token_threshold`, and it also accumulates `progress.cost_used_cents` from `usage.metering_usd.total_usd`. `GoalBudget.max_cost_cents` is an optional hard limit checked alongside turns/tokens/minutes. Nudge events are contentful: the hidden message body carries the truncated synthesized goal, remaining gaps from the last verifier attempt, and progress/budget counters, plus a pointer to `validate_goal`/`snooze_goal`/`pause_goal`. The `pause_goal` tool (agent off-ramp) purges queued goal regenerates and parks the goal `paused` until the user resumes; `snooze_goal(minutes)` sets `GoalSnapshot.snoozed_until_ms` (1-1440 min) — the monitor skips snoozed goals (`GoalNudgeSkip::Snoozed`) and the snooze clears on the next user message via `goal_reset_no_progress`. `GoalSnapshot.stop_reason` records why a goal stopped (`goal_control`, `manual_abort`, `pause_goal: …`) and clears when the goal re-arms.

### Criteria and verification tiers

`set_goal` (tool and command) accepts optional structured `criteria: [{id, text, verify_hint?}]`, stored in goal-message meta, the ledger (`criteria_set`), and `GoalSnapshot.criteria`. The verifier prompt lists them and demands per-criterion `CRITERION <id>: MET|UNMET — note` lines, parsed by `parse_criteria_verdicts` into `GoalAttempt.criteria_verdicts`. Verifier infrastructure failures set `goal_verification_blocked_until_ms` (5 min backoff): while it is in the future the completion gate returns `VerificationUnavailable` immediately instead of re-running the verifier.

### Pursuit wire hygiene

`goal_pursuit` events with archival kinds (`pursuit_quiescent`, `budget_exhausted`, `no_progress`, `stopped`, `paused`, `snoozed`, `resumed`) never reach the provider wire — `linearize::is_linearization_only_message` drops them like `compression_report`. Nudges and verification kinds (`nudge`, `verified`, `verification_gaps`, `verification_blocked`, `transfer`) stay provider-visible because the model needs the pursuit context. All kinds remain in session messages, trajectories, and `GoalSnapshot.events`.

### Plan transitions

`handoff_to_mode` and mode-transition endpoints create a pinned `initial-plan` task document when transitioning into Task Planner with an `initial_plan`. The document is created with kind `plan`, role `planner`, and `pinned=true`; failures are non-blocking and reported/logged without mutating the source chat's cached provider state.

### Anthropic Thinking/Signatures

Thinking blocks with cryptographic signatures must be preserved verbatim — no JSON rebuilding, no field reordering. Signatures validate exact prior content-block sequence. During streaming, accumulate deltas preserving metadata (block_index, signature) separately from text. For multi-provider chats, strip provider-specific blocks (thinking/signatures) on model switch. `strip_thinking_blocks_if_disabled()` in prepare.rs removes them when model lacks reasoning support.

### Trajectories

Atomic writes (`.tmp` → rename). Rich JSON: id, title, model, mode, tool_use, messages, `goal`, task_meta, version, created_at, reasoning_effort, checkpoints_enabled, parent_id, root_chat_id, etc. `goal` is a serialized `GoalSnapshot` projection and is rebuilt from hidden goal messages on restore/restart when possible.

#### Storage layout

New chats use a per-conversation folder under `.refact/trajectories/`, with one uniform rule: a trajectory always lives at `<folder>/<chat_id>.json`.

```
.refact/trajectories/
  index.json                  one global index for every displayable chat
  <root_chat_id>/
    <root_chat_id>.json       the root chat itself
    <child_chat_id>.json      subagent / review agent / internal trace (legacy delegate records may remain)
  <legacy_id>.json            pre-existing flat files, still read and written in place
```

The folder is chosen by `chat_folder_name(chat_id, root_chat_id)`: the root chat id when it is present and valid, otherwise the chat's own id. Legacy flat files are never migrated — `save_trajectory_snapshot` resolves an existing file first (flat slot, own folder, then the index) and only creates a nested file when none exists, so a chat that already lives at `<id>.json` keeps being written there. `ensure_legacy_flat_slot_is_safe` refuses the write when the flat slot is squatted by a symlink or an id-mismatched file.

Index entries store a relative `file_name` (`"<folder>/<file>.json"`, forward slashes) validated by `index_entry_file_name_is_valid`, which accepts at most one folder level and rejects traversal, drive-absolute names, nested `index.json`, and non-`.json` names. Every index writer resolves its directory with `index_dir_for_trajectory_file` so an `index.json` is never created inside a chat folder.

Path resolution reads `index.json` directly (`read_trajectory_index`) and never reconciles: reconciliation (`list_trajectory_entries_from_index_or_rebuild`, which scans the root plus one folder level under the per-directory lock) belongs to listing/history surfaces only. This matters because saves resolve their destination through the same candidate path, and per-step subchat persistence would otherwise scan the whole tree on every step. When the index misses, the load path falls back to a bounded chat-folder scan; saves do not scan, because a new nested file's path is derived deterministically from `chat_folder_name`.

Internal traces are not indexed or enqueued for VecDB vectorization. `save_trajectory_snapshot` skips both side effects when `link_type` is an `internal:` trace, and each owning folder is pruned to the 200 newest persisted internal traces on a throttled interval, so counts can temporarily exceed that limit between prunes. This keeps `index.json`, the memory plane, and conversation folders bounded. Their paths stay resolvable because a persisted trace always carries a `root_chat_id`, so its location is deterministic. Directory walkers must decide file type with `entry.file_type()` / `symlink_metadata` — `DirEntry::metadata()` follows symlinks and silently defeats the symlink guard.

Task-owned trajectories keep their own layout under `tasks/<task_id>/trajectories/{planner,agents/<agent_id>,subchats}/`, and buddy chats under `.refact/buddy/chats/conversations/`. Anything scanning the trajectories root must descend one folder level.

#### Internal traces

Every subchat persists, including non-stateful internal ones, except the one-shot `segment_summarize` subchat, whose successful and failed traces are ephemeral. `run_subchat` saves a seed before the loop and `persist_subchat_progress` re-saves after each LLM step and tool step, so an in-progress subagent trajectory can be opened and inspected live; failures save partial work with an `event(system_notice, "subchat.run")` note. The segment-summarizer exception skips all of those trajectory writes without changing its returned messages or errors.

Non-stateful subchats are tagged `link_type = "internal:<feature>"` (`internal_trace_link_type`). `is_internal_trace_link_type` keeps them out of chat history listings while leaving them openable by direct link.

Attribution is carried by `SubchatConfig.trace_parent` (`TraceParent { chat_id, root_chat_id }`), which decides only the trace folder and has no effect on runtime chat semantics — it is deliberately separate from `config.root_chat_id`, which flows into `AtCommandsContext`. `TraceParent::trace_folder_owner()` prefers the root chat id over the immediate chat id. `run_subchat_once`, `run_subchat_once_with_abort`, `run_subchat_once_with_parent`, and `run_subchat_once_with_explicit_params` all take a `TraceParent` so each call site must state its owner explicitly. Traces fall back to the shared `internal/` bucket (`UNATTRIBUTED_TRACES_DIR`) only where no owning conversation exists: MCP sampling (the client handler spans multiple chats), task briefings (cached per task, shared across chats), stateless HTTP endpoints such as code edit and diff-only commit messages, and workspace-wide background loops.

OpenAI conversion lives in `src/llm/adapters/openai_chat.rs` (`convert_messages_to_openai()`).

## Tools

~50+ tools, filtered by mode/capabilities/config. Registered in `tools_list.rs`.

**Categories**: Codebase search (CodeGraph definitions, tree, cat, regex, semantic memory) · CodeGraph analysis (overview, health, git risk, why, duplication, dead code, security scan, PR blast, map) · Codebase change (create/update/rm/mv/undo/apply_patch — confirmation required) · Web (fetch, search, Chrome automation) · Code execution (shell, process_*, sleep, cron_*) · System integrations (cmdline_*, service_*) · Knowledge (search, create, trajectories) · Agent (subagent, review — a multi-agent review swarm with normal/deep depths and idle-based agent watchdogs; see `docs/review_pipeline.md`) · Task management (~18 tools) · IDE (open_file, paste_text) · Integration-defined + MCP tools.

`AtCommandsContext` provides: global_context, chat_id, n_ctx, abort_flag, messages, current_model, task_meta, subchat depth/channels, postprocess params.

### Background subagents and coordination

`subagent` is the only tool that creates new background agents. It always starts a stateful child
trajectory and returns immediately; completion is pushed to the parent. Omitting `tools` preserves the
child's inherit-all policy; an explicit comma-separated list is validated against the registered tool
catalog. `model_name` selects a concrete configured chat model and takes precedence over `model_type`,
whose valid slots are `default`, `light`, `thinking`, `buddy`, `model_2`, and `task_planner`.

The optional `goal` accepts a string or `{content, criteria?, budget?}` object; use
`goal.budget.max_turns` to bound child steps. `plan` installs the child's plan. `target_files` communicates
expected edit targets and is compared with active peers for collision warnings. `worktree` is `inherit` by
default or `isolated`; isolated worktrees default `auto_merge` to true and retain conflict state for the
parent to inspect. The old `delegate` tool is not registered; legacy delegate records remain supported for
deserialization and display.

The interaction surface is `agents_overview`, `agent_message`, and child-only `progress_report`.
`agents_overview` renders the root-scoped agent tree with active work and questions.
`agent_message` sends to a child or descendant, or uses `to: "parent"` for a note or a tracked question
with `expects_reply`; a parent answers a question with its `reply_to` id. `progress_report` publishes a
child's concise status line. Existing lifecycle tools are `agent_list`, `agent_status`, `agent_wait`,
`agent_result`, and `agent_cancel` (which cancels descendants by default). Agent records and their live
introspection fields are emitted through snapshots and `background_agent_updated` SSE events.

### CodeGraph tools

CodeGraph-dependent tools are visible only when `gcx.codegraph` is available. `search_symbol_definition` is the compatibility definition lookup tool, backed by CodeGraph definitions, fuzzy suggestions, and `type_hierarchy` inheritance context; it does not read an old AST database. The dedicated CodeGraph analysis tool set is:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `codegraph_overview` | Project-wide summary from `cached_graph_analytics`: readiness warning, node/edge counts, SCCs/components, PageRank/betweenness symbols with paths, communities, entry points, API-contract files, and likely dead code. |
| `dead_code` | Static reachability candidates from cached CodeGraph data, with override/build-script/shell-entry exclusions, path and confidence filters, git recency/churn confidence, and partial-index warnings. |
| `code_health` | Per-file deterministic health: function complexity/nesting/LOC/maintainability index, duplication, structural/git/coverage/trend/performance findings, hot-path and fan-in graph enrichment, cached unchanged-file analysis, 1-10 defect/maintainability/performance scores, A-F grade, health-impact contributors, and refactoring targets. |
| `git_risk` | Git intelligence from mined history: churn/temporal hotspots, ownership and bus-factor risk, co-change/coupling pairs, reviewer ownership hints, recent commit risk factors, and git-biomarker findings with function facts for the top hotspot files. |
| `code_why` | Decision mining from significant commit prose, merge PR bodies, ADR files, and changelogs, reporting source refs, confidence, corroboration, provenance tags, and related-decision links. |
| `code_duplication` | Project-wide cross-file duplication from a graph-generation cache: token clone pairs, duplication percentage, git co-change counts joined to clone paths, co-change-weighted DRY findings, and test smells. |
| `security_scan` | Per-file/file-text security heuristics for deduped hardcoded secrets, dynamic SQL, command execution, dangerous eval/deserialization, TLS verification disabled, weak crypto, and insecure randomness. |
| `pr_blast` | Blast-radius analysis for changed files: indexed-path resolution, reverse CodeGraph dependency walk to bounded depth, direct/transitive impacted symbols, structural vs behavioral impact kind, impacted file count, risk score, git-ownership reviewer suggestions with bot authors filtered, and readiness/partial-index warnings. |
| `code_map` | Documentation-worthy map from CodeGraph and git signals: file centrality, churn hotspots, real symbol kinds and parsed visibility when present, file/module/SCC/API/infra pages, edge-derived links and backlink hubs, readiness warnings, optional hybrid query filtering, token budget trimming, and markdown or `claude_md` output. |

All nine tools return **JSON**, never formatted prose. The envelope is `ToolJson<T>` from `src/codegraph/code_intel_api.rs`:

```jsonc
{ "tool": "pr_blast", "summary": "PR blast radius: 10 impacted files, risk 0.71", /* ...flattened payload... */ }
```

`code_intel_api.rs` is the single source of truth for these shapes and is shared by the `/v1/code-intel/*` HTTP handlers and the agent tools, so the GUI types match both surfaces. Payloads: `codegraph_overview` → `OverviewResponse` plus `communities`/`execution_flows`/`dead_code`/`entry_points`/`api_contract_files`; `code_health` → `HealthResponse` plus `file_category`/`file_role`/`call_graph`/`coverage`/`warm_cache`; `git_risk` → `GitRiskResponse`; `code_duplication` → `DuplicationResponse`; `pr_blast` → `PrBlastResponse` plus `max_depth`; `dead_code` → `DeadCodeReport` plus `shown`/`total_candidates`; `security_scan` → `SecurityScanResponse`; `code_map` → page/link/hub arrays plus optional `markdown` for `claude_md`; `code_why` → `decisions`/`related` arrays.

Rules when changing them: readiness warnings are a `warning` field (never a `⚠` text prefix); empty/not-indexed branches still return valid JSON with an explanatory `summary`; only hard failures return `Err`; existing truncation limits stay so token cost does not grow; and a new field must be added to the Rust struct, the GUI interface in `engineAnalysisJson.ts`, and its adapter in the same change.

Code-intelligence surfaces use readiness fields rather than pretending a building index is complete. `CodeGraphService::index_readiness()` reports `queued`, `dirty_paths`, `pending_refs`, `cross_file_edges`, and `cross_file_ready`; overview, graph, health, PR blast, communities, dead-code, and code-map surfaces expose the relevant subset or warning text. `code_health` intentionally exposes two maintainability scales: `maintainability_index` is the classic MI-style structural metric, while `maintainability_score` / `avg_maintainability_signal` are normalized 1-10 health dimensions after findings are applied.

The health letter grade is a deliberate presentation-layer divergence from repowise's no-grade stance because GUI and user-facing summaries need a compact label. Numeric scores remain the source of truth; grades are only labels with cutoffs `A >= 9.0`, `B >= 7.5`, `C >= 6.0`, `D >= 4.0`, and `F < 4.0`.

### Exec runtime — PTY and process tools

The unified exec runtime owns foreground commands, background processes, and services. `shell` and `process_start` both accept `tty: bool` (default `false`):

- `tty: false` uses normal stdout/stderr pipes. Streams remain separate and output buffering follows pipe behavior.
- `tty: true` runs through the PTY path. It exposes an interactive stdin writer and combines stdout/stderr into the `combined` stream. Use it for REPLs, prompts, interactive CLIs, and programs that only flush when connected to a terminal.
- PTY output is transcripted through the same bounded runtime buffers as pipe output. PTY can change command behavior; do not turn it on for plain builds/tests unless needed.
- Windows uses the portable PTY backend (ConPTY where available). If the host cannot allocate a PTY, the tool must fail clearly rather than silently falling back to pipes.

#### `shell`

Model-facing prompt includes: run a command, `description` is required, `tty` enables PTY behavior, `run_in_background` returns immediately and points to process tools.

Schema highlights: `command: string` required, `description: string` required, optional `workdir`, optional `timeout`, optional output filters, optional `tty: boolean = false`, optional `run_in_background: boolean = false`.

Examples:

```json
{"command":"npm test","description":"Run frontend tests"}
{"command":"python3 -i","description":"Start Python REPL","tty":true,"run_in_background":true}
```

Edge cases: `description` must be non-empty; numeric `timeout` must be a positive integer; `run_in_background` skips the foreground timeout path and returns a process id; do not append `&` when using `run_in_background`.

#### `process_start`

Model-facing prompt: start a runtime-owned background or service process and return its process ID, initial status, output cursor, and metadata.

Schema highlights: `command: string`, `description: string`, optional `mode: "background" | "service"` (default `background`), optional `service_name` for services, optional `workdir`, optional `startup_wait_ms`, `startup_wait_port`, `startup_wait_keyword`, optional `tty: boolean = false`.

Examples:

```json
{"command":"npm run dev","description":"Start dev server","mode":"service","service_name":"web","startup_wait_port":5173}
{"command":"bash","description":"Open interactive shell","tty":true}
```

Edge cases: service mode requires `service_name`; duplicate running services in the same owner/workspace are rejected; workdir is resolved through active worktree privacy rules.

#### `process_list`

Schema: optional `status: "running" | "completed" | "all"` (default `running`), optional `scope: "chat" | "workspace" | "all"` (default `chat`). Returns process summaries under `extra.exec.processes`.

#### `process_read`

Schema highlights: `process_id: string` required, optional `since_seq`, optional `stream: "stdout" | "stderr" | "combined" | "all"`, optional output filters. It returns transcript chunks and cursor metadata (`since_seq`, `next_seq`, `latest_seq`) under `extra.exec.transcript`.

Empty-output reads are normal for long-running processes that have not emitted new chunks yet. Use the returned cursor for the next poll.

#### `process_wait`

Schema highlights: `process_id: string` required, optional `timeout_ms`, optional output filters. Waits until terminal status or timeout, then returns final/partial transcript metadata.

#### `process_kill`

Schema: `{ "process_id": "exec_..." }`. Kills a runtime-owned process and returns its terminal metadata. Use before restarting a service with the same name.

#### `process_write_stdin`

Planned/contracted tool for PTY processes. Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "process_id": { "type": "string" },
    "chars": { "type": "string", "default": "" },
    "yield_time_ms": { "type": "integer", "default": 250, "maximum": 10000 }
  },
  "required": ["process_id"]
}
```

Behavior contract: require a `tty=true` process, write `chars` bytes to stdin, then wait up to `yield_time_ms` for new output or exit. `chars: ""` means poll only: do not write, just wait and return new chunks. Output metadata should include standard `extra.exec` fields plus `bytes_written` and `chunks_returned`.

Example:

```json
{"process_id":"exec_123","chars":"echo hi\n","yield_time_ms":500}
```

Edge cases: reject non-PTY processes with a clear error; cap `yield_time_ms`; preserve exact bytes, including newlines/control characters.

### Background process notifications

`ExecRegistry` emits a completion event on the first terminal transition for background/service processes with an owning `chat_id`. `chat::notifications` subscribes from background tasks, waits until the chat is idle if generation/tool execution is active, then appends:

```json
{
  "role": "event",
  "content": "Process <description> exited with code 0",
  "extra": {
    "event": {
      "subkind": "process_completed",
      "source": "exec.registry",
      "payload": {
        "process_id": "exec_...",
        "status": "exited",
        "exit_code": 0,
        "duration_ms": 1234,
        "short_description": "Run dev server"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Foreground processes and records without `chat_id` do not inject notifications. Closed/missing chats are dropped cleanly. Current SSE delivery is the ordinary `MessageAdded` envelope carrying the hidden event; keep any future dedicated `ProcessCompleted` envelope additive and update GUI docs/tests together.

### `sleep`

Model-facing prompt: "Wait for the specified duration. User-interruptible at any time. Use when you have nothing to do, when waiting for something, or when the user asks you to pause. Prefer this over Bash(sleep ...) — it doesn't hold a shell process. You can call this concurrently with other tools."

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "duration_ms": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 100, "maximum": 3600000 },
    "tick_interval_ms": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 5000 },
    "description": { "type": "string", "description": "Short description (≤80 chars)." }
  },
  "required": ["duration_ms", "description"]
}
```

Returns `{ "slept_ms": number, "interrupted": boolean }`. If `tick_interval_ms` is set, it injects `event(tick, "tool.sleep", {elapsed_ms, remaining_ms}, "tick")` at each interval. Edge cases: duration max is 1 hour; abort returns early; description must be ≤80 chars.

## Scheduler / Automation Platform

The scheduler is now a small automation platform built around `Job { trigger, action, delivery }`.
Session jobs live in the in-memory `session_cron_store()` and disappear on engine restart. Durable
jobs are project-scoped and stored at `<project>/.refact/scheduled_tasks.json`.

### Job model

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trigger` | When work becomes due: `cron`, `interval`, `once`, `manual`, `webhook`, or reserved `on_process_exit`. |
| `action` | What runs: an agent turn or a foreground command. |
| `delivery` | Where command output goes: chat, outgoing webhook, notifier integration, or nowhere. |
| `recurring` | Explicit compatibility flag. `once` forces `false`; legacy one-shot cron jobs stay one-shot. |
| `durable` | `true` stores the job in `.refact/scheduled_tasks.json`; `false` stores it in memory. |
| `enabled` / `paused_at_ms` | Pause/resume state. Paused jobs skip ordinary schedule fires; a queued `trigger_at_ms` still makes the job due. |
| `trigger_at_ms` | Manual run marker set by `cron_update(run_now=true)`, HTTP run, or webhook dispatch. |
| `last_fired_at_ms`, `fire_count` | Last successful/error firing timestamp and counter. |
| `last_status`, `last_error`, `recent_runs` | Run history. `recent_runs` is capped by `scheduler.recent_runs_cap` (default 20). |
| `auto_expire_after_ms` | Recurring jobs default to 30 days and emit an auto-expire notice after the final fire. |
| `retry_attempts` | Transient retry counter for classifiable rate-limit/overload/network/timeout/5xx failures. |

Serialized shapes:

```json
{
  "id": "cron_...",
  "description": "Nightly build",
  "enabled": true,
  "durable": true,
  "created_at_ms": 1770000000000,
  "recurring": true,
  "trigger": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 2 * * *", "tz": "UTC" },
  "action": {
    "kind": "command",
    "argv": ["cargo", "check"],
    "target": { "kind": "isolated" },
    "cwd": ".",
    "env": null,
    "timeout_secs": 600
  },
  "delivery": { "kind": "webhook", "url": "https://example.test/hook", "token": "secret" },
  "last_fired_at_ms": null,
  "fire_count": 0,
  "last_status": null,
  "last_error": null,
  "recent_runs": [],
  "paused_at_ms": null,
  "trigger_at_ms": null,
  "auto_expire_after_ms": 2592000000,
  "retry_attempts": 0
}
```

Back-compat: `JsonFileCronStore` deserializes the old flat
`{ cron, prompt, chat_id, mode, ... }` shape into a nested `cron` trigger,
`agent_turn` action, and `chat` delivery. The next write persists only the nested
shape and drops the legacy `cron` / `prompt` top-level fields.

### Triggers

| Trigger | Public creation path | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `Cron { expr, tz }` | `cron` plus optional `tz` | 5-field cron, evaluated in `tz` or `scheduler_timezone()`; cron fires receive deterministic jitter. |
| `Interval { every_ms }` | `every: "30m"`, `"2h"`, `"1d"`, etc. | Repeats from `created_at_ms` / `last_fired_at_ms`; no cron jitter. |
| `Once { at_ms }` | `at` as RFC3339 or `in 30m` | One-shot; `recurring` is forced to `false` and the job is removed after fire/error/skip unless retry is scheduled. |
| `Manual` | Inline daemon hook agent jobs | No time-based next run; fired immediately through the manual runner. |
| `Webhook { hook_id }` | `trigger: {kind:"webhook", hook_id}` or top-level `hook_id` | No time-based next run; fired by daemon/worker hook dispatch. |
| `OnProcessExit { match_kind }` | Storage enum only | Reserved optional trigger; not created by public cron tools and has no time-based next run. |

`parse_schedule()` requires exactly one of `cron`, `every`, or `at`. A webhook trigger is
mutually exclusive with `cron`, `every`, `at`, and `tz`.

### Actions and targets

| Action | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_turn` | `{ kind, prompt, target, mode?, model?, tools? }` | Enqueues a `ChatCommand::UserMessage`. Existing-chat targets require an open/restorable chat id. Isolated targets create a fresh `cron_<job_id>_<fire_ms>` chat per fire. |
| `command` | `{ kind, argv, target, cwd?, env?, timeout_secs? }` | No-agent path. Runs via the exec registry as a foreground non-PTY command. `command` input is shell-split into `argv`; `command_argv` is used verbatim. `cwd` must stay inside the active project. Default timeout is 300s, capped at 3600s. |

Public `cron_create` does not expose `env`; it stores `env: null`. Command output is captured
from stdout/stderr with exec transcript limits. Command jobs can target chat for output delivery,
but `webhook`, `notifier`, and `none` deliveries do not require a chat target.

### Delivery

| Delivery | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `chat` | Agent turns enqueue into chat. Command jobs append `event(cron_fire)` and a `plain_text` output message; error output becomes a `system_notice`. Empty output is silent. |
| `webhook` | Command jobs POST `{job_id, description, status, output, ts}` to `url` with optional `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tool/HTTP responses expose `has_token`, never the token. Timeout is 10s. |
| `notifier` | Command jobs resolve `integration_id` through the notifier framework and call `NotifierBackend::send(target, output)`. Current built-in backend: `notifier_telegram`. |
| `none` | Command output is discarded after run history is recorded. |

Non-chat delivery is supported for command jobs only. Agent-turn jobs and inline daemon agent hooks
must use `chat` delivery.

### Runtime behavior

- Background startup spawns the session runner and, when an active project exists, a durable runner
  over `<project>/.refact/scheduled_tasks.json`. `REFACT_DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1` suppresses runner spawn.
  `--no-scheduler`, engine `scheduler.enabled: false`, and daemon `scheduler.enabled: false` are
  resolved through `SchedulerConfig`; disabled daemon schedulers still scan durable schedules for
  status/idle-stop visibility but do not wake workers.
- `schedule::next_run_ms` is the shared dispatcher used by the runner, cron-clock wakeups, list output,
  and create/update validation.
- Existing-chat agent turns and chat-delivered command jobs defer while the chat is busy, paused, missing,
  or closed. Busy defers retry after 30s; invalid targets defer after 60s for durable/recurring jobs.
- Command jobs and isolated agent-turn jobs use the cron lane and are bounded by
  `scheduler.max_concurrent_runs` (default 8).
- Durable catch-up runs on runner start. Legacy one-shot cron jobs whose first scheduled time passed
  fire ASAP when their target can be restored; recurring jobs use `recurring_missed_grace_state()`.
- Missed recurring grace is half the schedule period clamped by `scheduler.missed_grace_min_ms` (default
  120s) and `scheduler.missed_grace_max_ms` (default 2h). Runs outside the grace window are advanced
  without replaying a burst.
- Classifiable transient failures (`429`/rate-limit, overload/529, network, timeout, HTTP 5xx) schedule
  retries using `scheduler.retry` (default delays: 60s, 120s, 300s; default max attempts: 3).
- The runner is best-effort at-most-once per due marker: successful/error fires update
  `last_fired_at_ms` / `fire_count`, clear due `trigger_at_ms`, and one-shot jobs are removed unless a
  retry was scheduled. Chat and isolated jobs are counted only after their scheduled prompt is accepted
  by the queue; command jobs are counted after the command run completes.
- Run history status values include `fired`, `error`, `deferred`, `skipped`, and `advanced`.
- Recurring jobs auto-expire after `auto_expire_after_ms` when set. The default for recurring jobs is
  30 days; one-shot jobs use `0`.

### Cron tools

#### `cron_create`

Model-facing prompt: schedule an agent prompt or command for cron, interval, one-shot, or webhook
triggering. Cron expressions are standard 5-field expressions evaluated in the local timezone unless
`tz` is supplied. Webhook jobs never time-fire.

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "cron": { "type": "string", "description": "Standard 5-field cron expression in local time. Required unless every or at is set." },
    "every": { "type": "string", "description": "Interval such as 30m, 2h, or 1d. Mutually exclusive with cron and at." },
    "at": { "type": "string", "description": "One-shot time as RFC3339 or relative duration such as in 30m. Mutually exclusive with cron and every." },
    "trigger": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "kind": { "type": "string", "enum": ["webhook"] },
        "hook_id": { "type": "string", "description": "Inbound daemon hook id that fires this job." }
      },
      "required": ["kind", "hook_id"],
      "description": "Webhook trigger. Mutually exclusive with cron, every, and at. Webhook jobs never time-fire."
    },
    "hook_id": { "type": "string", "description": "Shortcut for trigger {kind:'webhook', hook_id}." },
    "tz": { "type": "string", "description": "IANA timezone for cron schedules, such as UTC or Asia/Kolkata." },
    "prompt": { "type": "string", "description": "Prompt enqueued at each fire time. Mutually exclusive with command and command_argv." },
    "command": { "type": "string", "description": "Command line to shell-split and run without an agent turn. Mutually exclusive with prompt and command_argv." },
    "command_argv": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "description": "Command argv to run without an agent turn. Mutually exclusive with prompt and command." },
    "cwd": { "type": "string", "description": "Optional command working directory, resolved under the active project." },
    "timeout_secs": { "type": "integer", "description": "Optional command timeout in seconds." },
    "delivery": {
      "oneOf": [
        { "type": "string", "enum": ["chat", "none"] },
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "kind": { "type": "string", "enum": ["webhook"] },
            "url": { "type": "string" },
            "token": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["url"]
        },
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "kind": { "type": "string", "enum": ["notifier"] },
            "integration_id": { "type": "string" },
            "target": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["integration_id"]
        }
      ],
      "description": "Delivery target: chat (default), none, webhook {url, token?}, or notifier {integration_id, target?}."
    },
    "recurring": { "type": "boolean", "default": true },
    "durable": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Persist in the current project when true; stay session-only when false. Omitted defaults to durable when a project store exists." },
    "isolated": { "type": "boolean", "default": false, "description": "Create a fresh isolated chat session for each fire instead of enqueueing into the current chat." },
    "description": { "type": "string", "description": "Short description (≤80 chars) shown in cron_list UI." }
  },
  "required": ["description"]
}
```

Validation: one schedule source (`cron` / `every` / `at` / webhook) and one action
(`prompt` / `command` / `command_argv`) are required. Descriptions over 80 chars,
invalid timezones, schedules with no match in the next year, and more than 50 jobs are rejected.
`prompt` with non-chat delivery is rejected.

Returns `{ id, human_schedule, recurring, durable, action_kind, delivery, isolated }` and appends a
`system_notice` event summarizing the created job. Webhook tokens are stored for delivery but returned
only as `has_token`.

Examples:

```json
{"cron":"0 9 * * 1-5","prompt":"Prepare the daily standup summary","recurring":true,"durable":true,"description":"Daily standup prep"}
{"every":"30m","command":"cargo check","delivery":"none","description":"Build check"}
{"at":"in 30m","command_argv":["python3","scripts/check.py"],"delivery":{"kind":"webhook","url":"https://example.test/hook","token":"secret"},"description":"One-shot check"}
{"hook_id":"deploy","command":"./deploy.sh","delivery":{"kind":"notifier","integration_id":"notifier_telegram","target":"12345"},"description":"Deploy hook"}
```

#### `cron_list`

Model-facing prompt: list scheduled tasks with target chat and mode, optionally filtering by
session-only or durable scope.

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "scope": { "type": "string", "enum": ["session", "durable", "all"], "default": "all" }
  },
  "required": []
}
```

Returns an array sorted by `next_fire_at_ms` then `id`. Tool rows contain
`{ id, cron, human_schedule, description, prompt, action_kind, delivery, chat_id, target,
isolated, mode, recurring, durable, next_fire_at_ms, fire_count, created_at_ms }`. `prompt` is
truncated to 200 chars; non-time triggers have `next_fire_at_ms: 0`.

#### `cron_update`

Model-facing prompt: update, pause, resume, or run a scheduled task by ID.

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "cron": { "type": "string" },
    "every": { "type": "string" },
    "at": { "type": "string" },
    "tz": { "type": "string" },
    "prompt": { "type": "string" },
    "description": { "type": "string" },
    "enabled": { "type": "boolean" },
    "run_now": { "type": "boolean" }
  },
  "required": ["id"]
}
```

Schedule updates use the same `parse_schedule()` rules as create; `tz` must accompany a cron
schedule. Updating to `at` forces `recurring=false`. `prompt` can only change `agent_turn` jobs;
command jobs reject prompt updates. `enabled=false` pauses and records `paused_at_ms`; `enabled=true`
resumes. `run_now=true` sets `trigger_at_ms` and wakes the runner. Returns
`{ id, updated: true, human_schedule }`.

#### `cron_delete`

Model-facing prompt: cancel a scheduled task by ID.

Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" } },
  "required": ["id"]
}
```

Removes from the session store first, then the active durable store. Returns `{ "removed": boolean }`
and notifies the runner only when a job was removed.

### HTTP scheduler surface

Routes live under `/v1/scheduler/cron`:

| Route | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/scheduler/cron` | none | `CronTaskResponse[]` with `enabled`, `paused`, trigger fields (`trigger_kind`, `hook_id`, `tz`, `every_ms`, `at_ms`), `last_status`, `last_error`, and `recent_runs`. |
| `POST /v1/scheduler/cron` | `CronCreateRequest` | `{ id, human_schedule, recurring, durable, action_kind, delivery }` |
| `PATCH /v1/scheduler/cron/:id` | `CronUpdateRequest` | `{ id, updated, human_schedule }` |
| `POST /v1/scheduler/cron/:id/run` | none | Sets `trigger_at_ms`; returns `{ id, triggered: true }`. |
| `DELETE /v1/scheduler/cron/:id` | none | `{ removed }` |

HTTP creation mirrors `cron_create` plus `chat_id` and `mode`. If `durable` is omitted, HTTP and
`cron_create` persist into the active project store when one exists; explicit `durable: false`
keeps the job session-only. If the request creates an agent turn or uses `chat` delivery, `chat_id`
must name an existing open chat. HTTP list responses flatten trigger details for the GUI and still
redact webhook tokens as `has_token`.

### Daemon cron clock

The headless daemon does not run jobs itself. Its `cron_clock` scans each open project's
`.refact/scheduled_tasks.json`, records the nearest pending durable job, and wakes the project worker
about 90s before fire time. The scan intentionally supports only durable cron-triggered
`agent_turn` jobs targeting an existing chat with `chat` delivery; unsupported jobs are skipped by the
clock, but can still run once a worker is already alive.

`GET /cron/status` returns:

```json
{ "enabled": true, "jobs": 1, "next_wake_ms": 1770000000000 }
```

`jobs` is the count of projects with pending cron-clock entries, not a full job count.

### Daemon inbound webhooks

Daemon HTTP routes:

| Route | Body | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /hooks/wake` | `{project, text}` | Wakes the project worker and injects `text` as a `system_notice`. |
| `POST /hooks/agent` | `{project, message, mode?, model?, deliver?}` | Wakes the worker and fires an isolated inline agent job. Delivery must resolve to `chat`. |
| `POST /hooks/:name` | Mapping-specific body | Resolves `hooks.mappings[name]`, applies mapping defaults, wakes the worker, then forwards to `/v1/hooks/fire`. |
| `POST /hooks` | none | Authenticates, then returns `400 missing hook name` when hooks are enabled. |

Daemon config (`daemon.yaml`):

```yaml
bind: 127.0.0.1
mdns: {}
scheduler:
  enabled: true
  disable_durable: false
hooks:
  enabled: true
  token: hook-secret
  default_project: demo
  allowed_projects: [demo, /abs/path/to/project]
  mappings:
    deploy:
      project: demo
      kind: agent        # wake | agent
      mode: agent
      model: test-model
      deliver:
        type: chat
```

Project resolution order is request body `project` → mapping `project` → `default_project`.
Allowed projects can match project id, slug, or root path. Hook auth accepts `Authorization: Bearer`
or `x-refact-token`; query-string daemon tokens are rejected for hook routes. Hooks may be open only
when the daemon is bound to loopback (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`); non-loopback binds require `hooks.token`
or daemon auth and refuse to start otherwise. The worker forward token is the daemon auth token when
present, otherwise the hook token.
Daemon bind defaults to `127.0.0.1`; explicit `bind: 0.0.0.0` keeps LAN exposure opt-in. Daemon mDNS uses `mdns.enabled: true|false`; omitted means auto-advertise only for non-loopback binds. Advertisements use the generic `Refact Daemon` instance name and include TXT `auth=required|none`.

Worker endpoint `POST /v1/hooks/fire` accepts:

```json
{
  "kind": "wake",
  "text": "optional wake text",
  "message": "optional agent message",
  "mode": "agent",
  "model": "model-id",
  "hook_id": "deploy",
  "deliver": { "kind": "chat" }
}
```

`kind="wake"` with text injects a notice. `kind="agent"` with message creates and fires an isolated
manual `agent_turn` job. Any `hook_id` also fires matching stored `Trigger::Webhook` jobs from both
session and durable stores, so a single hook call may perform the inline action and stored webhook jobs.

### Non-goals / boundaries

- No chat-platform messaging gateway is implemented here. Deliveries are Refact chat session,
  outgoing HTTP webhook, configured notifier backend, or no-op.
- Slack/email notifiers are framework-ready future plugins, not shipped backends. The in-tree notifier
  backend is Telegram (`notifier_telegram`).
- `OnProcessExit` is an optional/reserved trigger shape and is not wired through public cron creation or
  process-exit event handling.

## HTTP API

Base: `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1/`. Middleware: permissive CORS, 15MB body limit.

Key endpoints: `/ping`, `/caps`, `/graceful-shutdown`, `/p/{project_id}/v1/chats/{id}/commands`, `/p/{project_id}/v1/chats/subscribe` (project-scoped chat protocol; `daemon::chat_client::ProxyChatClient` is the in-tree client), `/chat` (legacy), `/code-completion`, `/code-lens`, `/tools`, `/tools-check-if-confirmation-needed`, `/ast-file-symbols`, `/ast-status` (legacy alias to CodeGraph status), `/rag-status`, `/vdb-search`, `/vdb-status`, `/codegraph-search`, `/codegraph-status`, `/code-intel/*`, `/git-commit`, `/checkpoints-preview`, `/checkpoints-restore`, `/integrations`, `/integration-get`, `/integration-save`, `/knowledge/update-memory`, `/knowledge/delete-memory`, `/knowledge-graph`.

## CodeGraph and indexing

CodeGraph is the source-code index. `codegraph_init()` opens a persistent SQLite schema v7 database at `~/.cache/refact/codegraph/<project-hash>/codegraph.sqlite` (or `~/.cache/refact/codegraph/codegraph.sqlite` when no project root is known), and `codegraph_background_task()` drains the workspace queue, indexes or removes changed paths, reconciles deleted paths on startup, and connects pending usages periodically after 8 batches or 30 seconds as well as on drain completion. The store contains graph nodes/edges/symbols, pending references, dirty paths, file hashes, a reserved `schema_version` meta row plus tool-owned meta KV, and an FTS5 `fts_code` table. Parser coverage comes from `refact-codegraph-parsers`: Rust, Python, JavaScript/JSX, TypeScript/TSX, Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Bash, Elixir, OCaml, Haskell, Go, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and Scala.

`CodeGraphService` is the async facade used by tools, HTTP, completion, and code-lens surfaces. It exposes counts, search, definition lookup, `doc_usages`, `type_hierarchy`, `index_readiness`, `graph_generation`, `meta_get`/`meta_set`, `cached_graph_analytics`, communities, execution flows, dead-code analysis, security scan, and PR blast-radius helpers. The cross-file resolver tries path-qualified/local names before bare names, and fuzzy last-segment matches only when the candidate is globally unique or uniquely in the same file; ambiguous candidates are skipped rather than creating speculative edges. `doc_usages` is consumed by completion RAG and CodeLens debug output, and `type_hierarchy` is consumed by `search_symbol_definition` inheritance context.

Cached analytics are generation-keyed by `graph_generation`, which bumps when indexing, removals, or usage-connection changes mutate graph data. The shared analytics cache covers graph overview data, file centrality, communities, and dead-code candidates; cross-file clone analysis has a separate generation-keyed cache, and health analysis caches unchanged per-file results by content hash plus git/coverage/trend signatures. `wiki.rs`, `vec_code`, and code-embedding search paths are not part of the current CodeGraph/codewiki pipeline; code-map output uses `refact-codewiki` page selection and rendering over CodeGraph and git signals. Code-intelligence severity unions are `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, and `Critical`; there is no `Info` variant.

`indexing_routing.rs` is the memory-plane firewall. It builds `MemoryPlaneRoots` from project roots, global knowledge, and global trajectories, then partitions paths before enqueueing: memory-plane paths go to VecDB, source-code paths go to CodeGraph. `vecdb_only=true` returns after memory enqueueing, and if CodeGraph is unavailable the router skips code files instead of sending them to VecDB. Keep this boundary intact so code search does not pollute memory/knowledge retrieval.

Status and code-intelligence surfaces:

- `GET /v1/codegraph-status` returns `{ counts: { nodes, edges, files, fts_docs }, queued, cross_file_edges, cross_file_ready, throughput_files_per_min, eta_seconds, state, error }`.
- `state` is one of `turned_off`, `indexing`, `working`, or `error`.
- `POST /v1/codegraph-search` accepts `{ "query": string, "top_n": number }` and returns `{ query_text, results: [{ path, line1, line2, symbol, score }] }`.
- `GET /v1/rag-status` embeds `codegraph` plus top-level `codegraph_alive` and `codegraph_error`, alongside legacy `ast`/`ast_alive` and VecDB status fields.
- `GET /v1/ast-status` is a legacy compatibility alias that returns CodeGraph status; `/v1/ast-file-symbols` reads file definitions from CodeGraph.
- `/v1/code-intel/overview`, `/graph`, `/communities`, `/dead-code`, `/health`, `/git-risk`, `/duplication`, `/pr-blast`, and `/security-scan` back the GUI code-intelligence page and mirror the tool implementations where applicable. Overview/graph/health/pr-blast responses carry top-level `index_state`; `/communities` returns an array with readiness attached per item; `/dead-code` returns a `DeadCodeReport` envelope (`entries`, `index_state`, `partial`, optional `warning`); PR blast also returns `partial` and `warning` when impact may be under-reported. Response structs live in `src/codegraph/code_intel_api.rs` and are shared with the agent tools, so changing one changes both surfaces.

Current worker CLI flags are `--ast`, `--wait-ast`, `--vecdb`, `--vecdb-max-files`, `--vecdb-force-path`, and `--wait-vecdb`. CodeGraph opens during startup and readiness is observed through the status routes. Daemon and IDE project settings may carry CodeGraph feature switches for host coordination, but worker process arguments still gate only AST compatibility and VecDB; do not add CodeGraph-specific CLI switches to docs unless they exist in `global_context.rs`.

## VecDB

SQLite + vec0 extension for memory-plane semantic search. File splitters handle trajectory JSON (4 msgs/chunk), Markdown (heading-aware), and other memory documents. Embedding uses the configured external HTTP API with batching/retry. Search: cosine KNN → reject threshold → normalize usefulness score. Background thread: enqueue → split → cache check → embed → store. Cleanup keeps 10 newest tables and drops tables older than 7 days. Source-code indexing belongs to CodeGraph; `indexing_routing.rs` prevents code paths from being enqueued into VecDB during workspace indexing.

### Concurrent-chat performance switches

The trajectory writer, trajectory index coordinator, watcher self-write suppression, tool catalog snapshots, and VecDB path coalescing are **enabled by default** and remain independently configurable through trajectory settings. Their settings are `trajectory_writer_enabled`, `trajectory_index_coordinator_enabled`, `trajectory_watcher_self_write_enabled`, `tool_catalog_snapshots_enabled`, and `vecdb_path_coalescing_enabled`, all defaulting to `true`. The environment overrides `REFACT_TRAJECTORY_WRITER`, `REFACT_TRAJECTORY_INDEX_COORDINATOR`, `REFACT_TRAJECTORY_WATCHER_SELF_WRITE`, `REFACT_TOOL_CATALOG_SNAPSHOTS`, and `REFACT_VECDB_PATH_COALESCING` take precedence over persisted settings; each accepts trimmed, case-insensitive `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`, and any other value, including `0` or `false`, disables that switch. Persisted writer, index coordinator, tool catalog, and VecDB changes require restart; watcher self-write suppression applies live. Set an individual switch to `false` in trajectory settings, or set its environment override to `0`, to restore its legacy path. VecDB's switch affects deferred regular paths only; immediate enqueue behavior is unchanged. This changes no trajectory JSON or index schema, performs no migration, and deletes no data. Full-soak benchmarks set and restore all five values serially, using all-off `legacy` and all-on `optimized` variants.

### Performance telemetry and trajectory settings API

`GET /v1/performance/telemetry` returns schema version `1`, the process-local collection state and start time, uptime, aggregate component counters, aggregate rollups, and the resolved five rollout-switch values. Component and rollup aggregates contain only bounded labels and numeric counts, latency percentiles, timestamps, and byte/item/batch totals. The response does not expose raw chat IDs, paths, queries, prompts, arguments, or message content. Collection starts disabled unless `REFACT_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS` is truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`) when the process initializes. `POST /v1/performance/telemetry` with `{ "enabled": boolean }` changes collection for the running engine and returns schema version `1` plus the resulting state. `POST /v1/performance/telemetry/reset` clears the in-process aggregates, resets their start time, preserves the current enabled state, and returns `{ schema_version: 1, reset: true, enabled }`. Runtime enablement is not persisted across an engine restart.

`GET /v1/trajectory-settings` supplies the persisted `config`, active `current` settings, `defaults`, per-field `name`/`value_type`/range/`apply_mode` metadata, and environment-precedence text. An absent settings file resolves to these defaults:

| Group | Fields, default, and valid range | Apply mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retention | `internal_traces_keep_per_folder`: 200, 10–10,000; `internal_trace_prune_interval_secs`: 3,600, 60–86,400; `buddy_conversations_keep`: 500, 10–100,000; `buddy_conversations_prune_interval_secs`: 3,600, 60–86,400; `buddy_conversations_prune_min_age_secs`: 86,400, 60–31,536,000 | Live |
| Session lifecycle | `session_idle_timeout_secs`: 1,800, 60–86,400; `session_cleanup_interval_secs`: 300, 10–86,400; `stream_idle_timeout_secs`: 300, 10–86,400; `stream_total_timeout_secs`: 1,800, 60–172,800 | Live |
| Chat limits | `max_queue_size`: 100, 1–10,000; `event_channel_capacity`: 4,096, 16–1,000,000; `recent_request_ids_capacity`: 100, 1–100,000; `max_parallel_tools`: `null` (unbounded) or 1–10,000; `max_images_per_message`: 50, 1–1,000; `max_file_size`: 40,000, 1,024–50,000,000 | Live except `event_channel_capacity`, which requires restart |
| Automatic enrichment | `auto_enrichment_total_token_cap`: 1,600, 64–32,000; `auto_enrichment_card_token_cap`: 480, 32–16,000 and no greater than the total cap; `auto_enrichment_knowledge_top_n`: 3, 1–20; `auto_enrichment_trajectory_top_n`: 2, 1–20 | Live |
| Performance rollouts | `trajectory_writer_enabled`, `trajectory_index_coordinator_enabled`, `trajectory_watcher_self_write_enabled`, `tool_catalog_snapshots_enabled`, and `vecdb_path_coalescing_enabled`: all `true` | Watcher self-write suppression is live; the other four require restart |

`POST /v1/trajectory-settings` persists and validates a complete `TrajectoryRuntimeSettings`, then applies its live fields. It accepts either the direct configuration object or `{ "config": completeConfiguration }`. This is a full-replace contract, not a patch: omitted fields silently deserialize to defaults and overwrite their prior persisted values. Clients **must** merge edits onto the last server-returned complete `config` and post that complete object, including any unknown or unrendered fields, or they risk silent settings data loss. The five rollout environment variables above still win over the persisted setting at runtime.

## Providers

15+ providers in `src/providers/`: Anthropic, Claude Code, OpenAI, Codex, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, LM Studio, Ollama, OpenRouter, vLLM, xAI, custom. Each defines ProviderDefaults (chat/completion/embedding models). OAuth support for Codex/Claude Code. YAML configs in `yaml_configs/default_providers/`.

## Integrations

GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Chrome (headless), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, PDB, shell, cmdline_* (one-off), service_* (long-running), MCP (stdio + SSE). Config: `.refact/integrations/*.yaml`. Trait: `integr_tools()`, `integr_schema()`, `integr_settings_apply()`.

## Per-destination privacy

Privacy policy classifies paths into ordered zones and decides which destinations may receive each zone. Legacy `blocked` patterns form a deny zone before the configured list; otherwise the first matching zone applies, and an omitted `normal` zone is supplied as an allow-all catch-all. Matching considers normalized supplied, absolute, canonical, basename, root-relative, registered worktree/source-alias, and on Unix hard-link-identity candidates. When several candidate paths apply, the effective zone intersects every `send_to` set and combines `on_shell_read` as `deny` over `ask` over `withhold`; a named zone is reused when it has that result, otherwise the zone name is `effective:<sorted names>`. Each zone has `patterns`, `send_to`, and `on_shell_read`; an empty `send_to` denies every destination, while `"*"` allows every current and future destination. Destination kinds are `provider`, `mcp`, `subagent_model`, and `completion`. Model destinations use the provider-qualified model id prefix before `/`; MCP destinations use the configured server name.
`tool_access.providers.<provider>.mcp` is a second axis stored in the same policy file. It governs which MCP servers a model provider may use tools from, not which files may reach a destination, and it shares the destination id space (provider prefix before `/`, MCP server name). A provider absent from `providers` may use every server, so adding the section never removes tools that already worked; `"*"` means every current and future server. Project privacy files may only narrow a provider's list, because `merge_project` intersects it the same way it intersects `send_to`. Enforcement is not schema omission. `mcp_tool_allowed(policy, provider, desc)` is the single predicate; `get_tools_for_mode` applies it before `apply_mcp_lazy_filter` builds the `mcp_tool_search`/`mcp_call` proxies, `subchat_single_internal` applies it to subagent tool schemas, and both proxies re-apply it because they resolve tools directly from `get_integration_tools` rather than from the mode tool list. It fails closed: when an allowlist exists and the provider is unknown (empty model id), every MCP tool is denied. The only exemption is `AtCommandsContext.tool_access_bypass`, which defaults to false and is set exactly once, by Buddy's GitHub-issue creation, because that path is the application itself calling MCP with no model provider in play.

`GET /v1/privacy/policy` returns the **global-only** policy as the editable document, so posting it back can never persist project-file restrictions into the global file; `match_counts`, destinations, and every runtime gate keep using the merged effective policy from `gcx.privacy_policy_load`, and `has_project_overrides` tells the GUI a project file is narrowing things further. The handler loads caps through `try_load_caps_quickly_if_not_present` before enumerating destinations, tolerating failure, and enumerates MCP destinations from configured integration records plus live sessions, so a configured-but-not-running server is still selectable.


The chat/completion wire-adapter egress path is compiler-sealed: `LlmWireAdapter::build_http` accepts only `&Cleared<LlmRequest>`, whose constructor is private to `refact-privacy`, and each attempt in `run_llm_stream` obtains that token through `clear()` for the resolved destination. Runtime clearance compiles the policy, checks recorded zone names through that compiled policy, and fails closed on malformed privacy metadata or policy compilation. Memory-plane file vectorization does not use `LlmWireAdapter`; a runtime gate classifies each queued path for the embedding provider before reading it or sending chunks, removes previously indexed guarded files, and skips disallowed files. The shared provider client and the VecDB embedding client refuse redirects. MCP and subagent boundaries perform their own runtime destination checks, and adapter output must not serialize privacy metadata.

File provenance is stored on chat messages as `extra.privacy = { "files": [{ "path", "zone", "attribution" }] }`. The three attribution values are `declared` for paths known by a file-reading tool, `observed` for syscall-observed reads, and `heuristic` for best-effort command parsing when observation is unavailable. Summary and compression paths union and preserve these records so later destination checks still see source provenance.

Shell and process observation does not block execution solely because observation is unavailable, pending, or incomplete. `Observed`, `Pending`, `Incomplete`, and `Unavailable` remain distinct statuses: pending/incomplete shell and process results enforce `on_shell_read` against the accesses captured so far, while unavailable observation continues with `extra.privacy_observation.degraded = true`, a tree-sitter Bash pass attributes existing literal paths as `heuristic`, and Buddy creates at most one process-lifetime warning. Degraded heuristic records are diagnostic and excluded from later egress clearance because they can miss expansions, substitutions, scripts, indirect reads, and unknown commands. For captured shell and process reads disallowed at the current destination, enforcement combines records as `deny` over `withhold` over `ask`; withheld output remains local in `extra.privacy_shell`. Stdio MCP separately records observed/pending/incomplete reads on tool results, records unavailable observation without blocking the call, and relies on the MCP destination check before dispatch. Within one live chat session, writes inherit one non-normal read record selected by the fewest allowed destinations, with read order breaking equal-size ties; later observed reads compare that derived zone with static classification by the same destination-count rule. Restored trajectories start with a fresh derived map.

Code completion is a distinct `completion` destination. Both completion endpoints resolve the completion model, classify the cursor file, and return HTTP 422 before cache or network use when the provider id is absent from that zone's `send_to`. Legacy controlled-server classification does not grant completion access.

### Standardized exec env

All foreground, background, service, and PTY exec spawns apply `EXEC_ENV_DEFAULTS` before request env overrides. Request-provided env values win. Defaults:

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_COLOR` | `1` | Keep transcripts stable and readable without ANSI color noise. |
| `TERM` | `dumb` | Discourage interactive/full-screen terminal behavior unless `tty=true`. |
| `LANG` | `C.UTF-8` | Provide deterministic UTF-8 locale. |
| `LC_CTYPE` | `C.UTF-8` | Preserve UTF-8 character classification. |
| `LC_ALL` | `C.UTF-8` | Avoid locale-specific output drift. |
| `COLORTERM` | empty | Disable color auto-detection. |
| `PAGER` | `cat` | Prevent commands from blocking in pagers. |
| `GIT_PAGER` | `cat` | Prevent git from blocking in pagers. |
| `GH_PAGER` | `cat` | Prevent GitHub CLI from blocking in pagers. |
| `REFACT_EXEC` | `1` | Marker that a process is running under Refact exec. |

## Testing

- **Integration tests in `tests/`**: live HTTP+SSE Python suites plus Rust e2e suites (`daemon_e2e.rs`, `daemon_proxy.rs`, `daemon_supervisor.rs`) that share the `tests/e2e_helpers/` module. Python helpers include `fake_worker.py` and `lsp_connect.py`; 7 `test_chat_session_*.py` files cover the chat session flow.
- **Rust unit tests**: `src/chat/tests.rs`, CodeGraph/parser tests, 50+ modules. `cargo test --lib`.
- **Test data**: `tests/emergency_frog_situation/` — themed frog simulations for parsing edge cases.

## Config

- **User**: `~/.config/refact/` (default_privacy.yaml, providers.d/*.yaml)
- **Cache**: `~/.cache/refact/` (shadow repos, logs, integrations, `codegraph/` SQLite stores)
- **Project**: `.refact/` (trajectories/, knowledge/, tasks/, integrations/, `project_information.yaml` — schema_version 1, toggles + size caps for the `system_info` / `environment_instructions` / `detected_environments` / `git_info` / `project_tree` / `instruction_files` / `project_configs` / `memories` sections surfaced to the model)
- **System prompts**: `yaml_configs/defaults/` — modes (built-in modes in `modes/`, plus project-setup wizard modes like `setup`, `setup_skills`, `setup_agents_md`, `setup_mcp`, `setup_commands`, `setup_subagents`, `setup_modes`, `setup_hooks`, `setup_knowledge`), subagents, toolbox commands. Magic vars: `%ARGS%`, `%CODE_SELECTION%`, `%WORKSPACE_INFO%`, `%PROJECT_TREE%`, `%MODELS_INFO%`. The latter expands, when the `models_info` project-information section is enabled, to model slots, catalog capabilities, privacy zones, and provider-to-MCP access.
